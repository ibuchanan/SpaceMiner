# SpaceMiner

SpaceMiner is a tool to help beginner programming students
learn JavaScript and programming concepts
in face-to-face or remote environments,
with peer collaboration and mentor/teacher assistance.

## Questions we're trying to address

* How can a beginner get started quickly,
and within one hour of coding for the first time produce a game that's:
  * Fun
  * Instructive
  * Unique
  * Playable at home once they leave
  * Shareable with others once they leave
  * And, easily resumable at home or next time
* How can we as mentors understand how well our tutorials
and lessons are helping students make real progress?
* How can students help each other improve and collaborate?
  * And, how can we hook them on "that old time agile" mindset?

## Current use

* [CoderDojo South ATX](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/South-Austin-Coworking/events/kswplnywmbfb/)
* [CoderDojo Ponce Springs](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/)
* [Mental Fitness Atlanta](http://www.mentalfitnessatl.org/)

## Current features (all work in progress!)

* Play worlds made by other students immediately without needing to login
* Create an account (without needing an email address)
* Fork and modify existing worlds
and modify the world map
and event handlers for collisions
* Step-by-step tutorials for learning JavaScript
within the context of building a world
  * Interactive lessons for improving understanding of concepts
    * With questions to test knowledge
    * Coding challenges before advancing
    * Mentor / Teacher interactive dashboard
      to monitor class progress and understanding
* Ability to send a world into "Test"
to get others to play it and leave feedback
* Ability to "release" a world into "Production"
(and soon to get ratings and stastics about difficulty,
average time per play, etc)
